### Overview

This is a simple web based app which is a data product that is a by product of a simple machine learning model is created using random forest. The dataset is the popular iris data set in R.


```{r}
head(iris)
```

### The model

The model was trained using the iris data set with `r nrow(iris)` rows. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(caret)
library(randomForest)

fit = train(Species~., data=iris, method='rf')
fit
```

### Evaluation

The model was evaluated using cross-validation leave-one-out estimate of the out of sample error. The accuracy of the model was `r mean(fit$results[,'Accuracy'])`, which is not that suprising given that random forest was used.


### The product

The app is hosted on [Project9](https://muqwnv-rebel-ai.shinyapps.io/Project9/)
